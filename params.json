{"name":"Cordobazombie","tagline":"","body":"![CordobaZombie](http://cordobazombie.com.ar/imagenes/logo-cbazb.png)\r\n## About \r\n**CodobaZombie** is a real time strategy game (RTS). It is a 3D game that takes place in Cordoba, Argentina, and it is a open source project. It is an open source project and we are currently developing this game with all of our best efforts in our free time.\r\n\r\nWe believe that a game with a size of this caliber will be useful for others to learn how to make a game from absolutely nothing. We are not a professional team though many of us have applied experience. We aim to create a polished product.\r\n\r\nOur objectives are:\r\n* Create a free-to-play open-source multi-platform (Windows and Linux minimum) game using open-source  tools.\r\n* Share knowledge and experience with others.\r\n* Manage a professional development process.\r\n* Become a starting point for future game developments.\r\n\r\nOur primary goal is to create a demo with a solid level and with core game elements. Once we receive the support we need (via sponsors and advertisers), we can become established as a full-time developer and finish the entirety game.\r\n\r\nYou can check the webpage of the game here (note that it is Spanish only, for now...):\r\n* [Official webpage](http://cordobazombie.com.ar/)\r\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CordobaZombie)\r\n\r\nIf you want to contact us then you can do it in:\r\n* General comments / questions: info@cordobazombie.com.ar\r\n* Development: agudpp@gmail.com\r\n\r\n_**If you want to help us with this project, do not hesitate to contact us! :).**_\r\n\r\n## Development\r\nWe are making the game with:\r\n* C++ as main language.\r\n* [OGRE](http://www.ogre3d.org/) as the render engine.\r\n* [OpenAL](http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/default.aspx) as sound library.\r\n* [ffmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org/) for videos.\r\n* [tinyxml](http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/) for xml.\r\n* [boost](http://www.boost.org/) and [stl](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/).\r\n* [cmake](www.cmake.org) for building.\r\n* and a lot of other things.\r\n\r\nThe design concept aims to make well-designed and documented code, follow and apply good programming practices; and of course; learn and share knowledge. We are currently in a transition stage trying to improve our \"old\" code and port it to use the new designed architecture and the new C++11 standard, unify the coding style and port the code to be more standard (we start the development in linux, so now we need to port it to be windows compatible).\r\n\r\nYou can check in the other wikis for the Architecture / Coding Style / Development methodologies / etc.\r\nSome of this things are new and probably are not perfectly reflected in all our code, as just said before, we are in a **transition stage** and trying to improve all the **Software development life-cycle** :).\r\n\r\n## Team\r\nThe global scale of the team is approximately 10 full-time members in different areas of the world along with others contributors that join us periodically. The development area is conformed by 3 main developers, 1 contributor and another one that is in the SCM part.\r\nIn the [facebook webpage](https://www.facebook.com/CordobaZombie) you can see some images of the team :).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
