{"name":"Cordobazombie","tagline":"","body":"![CordobaZombie](http://cordobazombie.com.ar/imagenes/logo-cbazb.png)\r\n## About \r\n**CodobaZombie** is a real time strategy game (RTS) or at least that is what we are trying to do :). It is a 3D game located in Cordoba, Argentina, and it is a open source project. We are currently developing this game by our owns, in our free times and giving the best of us and using of course open and free tools.\r\n\r\nWe also think that this **medium size** game could be useful for other peoples to learn about which are the basic things you need when you make a game from zero (or at least, you can see the things that you probably want to avoid :)). I said a medium size game since of course this is not a AAA game because we have not the time, money, technology, people nor experience to do one of that kind, but probably you can think this like a CCC game :).\r\n\r\nOur objectives are:\r\n* Create a free-to-play opensource multi-platform (Windows and Linux at least) game using opensource and free tools.\r\n* Share all the information/knowledge about our experiences / problems about all the development process.\r\n* Try to do this development process as much professionally as we can.\r\n* Be a starting point for future developments (games).\r\n\r\nIn a first instance, due to the time we have we will try to create a demo (one level with basic functionality) and then, if we get the support we need (sponsors / advertisers), get involved as a full time job and finish the full game :).\r\n\r\nYou can check the webpage of the game here (note that it is Spanish only, for now...):\r\n* [Official webpage](http://cordobazombie.com.ar/)\r\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CordobaZombie)\r\n\r\nIf you want to contact us then you can do it in:\r\n* General comments / questions: info@cordobazombie.com.ar\r\n* Development: agudpp@gmail.com\r\n\r\n_**If you want to help us with this project, do not hesitate to contact us! :).**_\r\n\r\n## Development\r\nWe are making the game with:\r\n* C++ as main language.\r\n* [OGRE](http://www.ogre3d.org/) as the render engine.\r\n* [OpenAL](http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/default.aspx) as sound library.\r\n* [ffmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org/) for videos.\r\n* [tinyxml](http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/) for xml.\r\n* [boost](http://www.boost.org/) and [stl](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/).\r\n* [cmake](www.cmake.org) for building.\r\n* and a lot of other things.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to make a well designed and commented code, follow and apply good programming practices, and of course, learn and share knowledge.\r\nWe are currently in a transition stage trying to improve our \"old\" code and port it to use the new designed architecture and the new C++11 standard, unify the coding style and port the code to be more standard (we start the development in linux, so now we need to port it to be windows compatible).\r\n\r\nYou can check in the other wikis for the Architecture / Coding Style / Development methodologies / etc.\r\nSome of this things are new and probably are not perfectly reflected in all our code, as just said before, we are in a **transition stage** and trying to improve all the **Software development life-cycle** :).\r\n\r\n## Team\r\nThe global team of the game is a core of approx 10 people in all the different areas, with a lot of others contributors that join us sporadically (almost all the time for a very little short period of times).\r\nThe development area is conformed by 3 main developers, 1 contributor and another one that is in the SCM part.\r\nIn the [facebook webpage](https://www.facebook.com/CordobaZombie) you can see some images of the team :).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
