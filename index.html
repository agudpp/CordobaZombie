<h2>About</h2>

<p><strong>CodobaZombie</strong> is a real time strategy game (RTS) or at least that is what we are trying to do :). It is a 3D game located in Cordoba, Argentina, and it is a open source project. We are currently developing this game by our owns, in our free times and giving the best of us and using of course open and free tools.</p>

<p>We also think that this <strong>medium size</strong> game could be useful for other peoples to learn about which are the basic things you need when you make a game from zero (or at least, you can see the things that you probably want to avoid :)). I said a medium size game since of course this is not a AAA game because we have not the time, money, technology, people nor experience to do one of that kind, but probably you can think this like a CCC game :).</p>

<p>Our objectives are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a free-to-play opensource multi-platform (Windows and Linux at least) game using opensource and free tools.</li>
<li>Share all the information/knowledge about our experiences / problems about all the development process.</li>
<li>Try to do this development process as much professionally as we can.</li>
<li>Be a starting point for future developments (games).</li>
</ul><p>In a first instance, due to the time we have we will try to create a demo (one level with basic functionality) and then, if we get the support we need (sponsors / advertisers), get involved as a full time job and finish the full game :).</p>

<p>You can check the webpage of the game here (note that it is Spanish only, for now...):</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>We are making the game with:</p>

<ul>
<li>C++ as main language.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/">OGRE</a> as the render engine.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/default.aspx">OpenAL</a> as sound library.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a> for videos.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/">tinyxml</a> for xml.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.boost.org/">boost</a> and <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/">stl</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="www.cmake.org">cmake</a> for building.</li>
<li>and a lot of other things.</li>
</ul><p>The idea is to make a well designed and commented code, follow and apply good programming practices, and of course, learn and share knowledge.
We are currently in a transition stage trying to improve our "old" code and port it to use the new designed architecture and the new C++11 standard, unify the coding style and port the code to be more standard (we start the development in linux, so now we need to port it to be windows compatible).</p>

<p>You can check in the other wikis for the Architecture / Coding Style / Development methodologies / etc.
Some of this things are new and probably are not perfectly reflected in all our code, as just said before, we are in a <strong>transition stage</strong> and trying to improve all the <strong>Software development life-cycle</strong> :).</p>

<h2>Team</h2>

<p>The global team of the game is a core of approx 10 people in all the different areas, with a lot of others contributors that join us sporadically (almost all the time for a very little short period of times).
The development area is conformed by 3 main developers, 1 contributor and another one that is in the SCM part.
In the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CordobaZombie">facebook webpage</a> you can see some images of the team :).</p>
