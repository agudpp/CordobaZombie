<h2>About</h2>

<p><strong>CodobaZombie</strong> is a real time strategy game (RTS). It is a 3D game that takes place in Cordoba, Argentina, and it is a open source project. It is an open source project and we are currently developing this game with all of our best efforts in our free time.</p>

<p>We believe that a game with a size of this caliber will be useful for others to learn how to make a game from absolutely nothing. We are not a professional team though many of us have applied experience. We aim to create a polished product.</p>

<p>Our objectives are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a free-to-play open-source multi-platform (Windows and Linux minimum) game using open-source  tools.</li>
<li>Share knowledge and experience with others.</li>
<li>Manage a professional development process.</li>
<li>Become a starting point for future game developments.</li>
</ul><p>Our primary goal is to create a demo with a solid level and with core game elements. Once we receive the support we need (via sponsors and advertisers), we can become established as a full-time developer and finish the entirety game.</p>

<p>You can check the webpage of the game here (note that it is Spanish only, for now...):</p>

</ul><p><em><strong>If you want to help us with this project, do not hesitate to contact us! :).</strong></em></p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>We are making the game with:</p>

<ul>
<li>C++ as main language.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/">OGRE</a> as the render engine.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/default.aspx">OpenAL</a> as sound library.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a> for videos.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/">tinyxml</a> for xml.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.boost.org/">boost</a> and <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/">stl</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="www.cmake.org">cmake</a> for building.</li>
<li>and a lot of other things.</li>
</ul><p>The design concept aims to make well-designed and documented code, follow and apply good programming practices; and of course; learn and share knowledge. We are currently in a transition stage trying to improve our "old" code and port it to use the new designed architecture and the new C++11 standard, unify the coding style and port the code to be more standard (we start the development in linux, so now we need to port it to be windows compatible).</p>

<p>You can check in the other wikis for the Architecture / Coding Style / Development methodologies / etc.
Some of this things are new and probably are not perfectly reflected in all our code, as just said before, we are in a <strong>transition stage</strong> and trying to improve all the <strong>Software development life-cycle</strong> :).</p>

<h2>Team</h2>

<p>The global scale of the team is approximately 10 full-time members in different areas of the world along with others contributors that join us periodically. The development area is conformed by 3 main developers, 1 contributor and another one that is in the SCM part.
In the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CordobaZombie">facebook webpage</a> you can see some images of the team :).</p>
